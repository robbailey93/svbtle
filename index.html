<h2>Syntagms, Narrative and the Lack of Fun</h2>

<h3>ETHAN KAPLAN</h3>

<p>When we look at social software services like Facebook and Twitter, we are really talking about systems who’s whole purpose is to get us to form narratives through them. We form these narratives by stringing together syntagms (fragments of text) into sequential interwoven dialogs that together form stories/narratives amongst others.</p>

<p>The feeds and reverse chronological way these are presented is the easiest distillation of what we contribute. We are story tellers through the medium provided by other services, in both active and passive means.</p>

<p>But when we remove all the artifice of software and features, what we are really doing is creating stories. Narratives about our day in a reverse chronological string of text and images. It mixes and infiltrates others to form meta-narratives that we hope, in the end, are contextualized somehow into something meaningful.</p>

<p>What draws these syntagms out is active and passive modes of story telling. Design contributes to the active, and technology to the passive. Together they are interwoven into these narratives that ultimately define “Me” within a specific context. Facebook for myself in other words is nothing but the collection of narratives that I gave (actively and not) to form my identity within it.</p>

<p>When we look at Facebook and the narrative around them vs Snapchat, Medium, and even Twitter, the difference isn’t what they do (they all are about narrative formation from storytelling through syntagms), but how they do it.</p>

<p>What is the key difference? Fun.</p>

<p>Facebook isn’t fun.</p>

<p>If we want to get to the root of what the problem is with it right now, that is the most simple way of putting it. The WSJ might profile it about its ad business, there might be others saying its “over” (even me, in the use/on dialog), but the reality is: for something that is supposed to represent my life, it isn’t as fun to use as living my life is. It’s a chore, and at some point when you take stock of how you spend your time, the chores are the first thing to go.</p>
